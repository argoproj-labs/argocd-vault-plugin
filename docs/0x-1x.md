#### Annotation Changes
In order to follow Kubernetes annotations, we have updated the supported annotations

| Old        | New |  
| ---------- | ----------- |  
| avp_path   | avp.kubernetes.io/path  |
| avp_ignore | avp.kubernetes.io/ignore |
| kv_version | avp.kubernetes.io/kv-version |

#### AVP Prefix
The `AVP` prefix is now required for all configurations options not including `VAULT` environment variables (https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands#environment-variables).

#### Removed PATH_PREFIX
The `PATH_PREFIX` environment variable has now been removed and is no longer available.

#### IBM Secrets Manager
With the addition of AWS Secrets Manager, we have renamed IBM Secrets Manager backend from `secretmanager` to `ibmsecretsmanager`.
